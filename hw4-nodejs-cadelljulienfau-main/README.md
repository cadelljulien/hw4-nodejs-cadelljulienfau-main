### Summary
For this homework I had 3 objectives to complete. Objective one dealt with having to install the software needed for the other objectives. The things installed were Node Version Manager or nvm to later on install Node.js. After everything was complete a screenshot was needed. Objective two dealt with having to to run eight example scripts. The scripts needed node.js to run and show an output. Some of them needed certain packages which were needed to be installed to help the script run. After everything was done we had to commit the examples. For objective three we continued working with nvm and had to change the node version. We later had to add/create a new script called sentiment-analysis.js. For the script to run we made a txt folder to hold a new article headline for it to read. After everything was done we took a screenshot of the output. After the screenshot was taken we had to them swtich versions again to run back the script in this version, then do a slight redo taking a screenshot and commiting. Overall this homework was pretty simple and easy to follow along.
